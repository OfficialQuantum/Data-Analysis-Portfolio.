## About
<p>
  <h2 align="center"> Hello, I'm Abdulkabir Abdulamid </h2>
  <h4 align="center"> A Data Scientist & Analyst </h4>
</p>

I'm currently expanding my skills in data analysis and data science, with a keen interest in leveraging data to uncover meaningful insights.

During my studies, I've developed a keen ability to work with complex data, identifying patterns and trends. I also have experience in data management and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in a data-focused role.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether collaborating within a team or working independently, I find joy in discovering new insights and using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
