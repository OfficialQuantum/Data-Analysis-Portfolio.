# Data-Analysis-Portfolio.
## About
Hello, I'm Abdulkabir! I'm currently expanding my skills in data analysis and data science, with a keen interest in leveraging data to uncover meaningful insights.

During my studies, I've developed a keen ability to work with complex data, identifying patterns and trends. I also have experience in data management and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in a data-focused role.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether collaborating within a team or working independently, I find joy in discovering new insights and using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
